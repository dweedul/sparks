# Displaying charts in text without having to use code

Sparks, now in its second release, is a family of 15 fonts (three variants in five weights each) that allows for the easy combination of text and visual data by removing the need for any technical know-how. By installing the Spark font you can use them immediately without the need for custom code.

Data can be hard to grasp however visualising it can make comprehension faster. Sparklines (tiny charts in text, like this: <span class="sparks dotline-extrathin">123{10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100}789</span>) are a useful tool, but creating them for the web has always required code and using them in word documents was previously impossible.

## Other types of chart are available

The different spark fonts allow for a degree of flexibility in the way different types of data can be displayed.
